# Splunk-Detection-Lab

## Objective
The Splunk Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting brute force attacks to understand the telemetry that generates, while using atmoic red team as well. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security and attack patterns.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Sysmon deployed on the Windows machine to log detailed system activities, which were then analyzed by Splunk.
- VMware Workstation Pro to create isolated environments for the attack and victim machines, allowing for safe and controlled simulation of cyber attacks and defenses.
- Ubuntu Server served as the operating system for the SIEM where Splunk was installed and used to .
- Windows 2022 Server housed Active Directory to store acount credentials
- Kali Linux system for brute force attacks on the windows machine
- Windows 10 as the
